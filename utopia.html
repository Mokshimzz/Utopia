                "In the 21st century, I believe the mission of the United Nations will be defined by a new, more profound awareness of the sanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of race or religion."
            </blockquote>
            <p>In tandem with this belief of Kofi Annan and taking a step forward towards concretising this dream, DPS Gurgaon takes pride in welcoming you all to the Utopia Model United Nations 2024 conference. MUN is a powerful experience for our young people to come together to listen, negotiate, collaborate and then offer solutions to some of our planet's most pressing problems. This program is an important step towards achieving our vision of educating youth for the world peace.</p>
            <p>The platform of utopia envisions delegates, the leaders of tomorrow, discussing global issues under the ambit of foreign and domestic policies. The conference has encouraged young minds to discuss, deliberate and arrive at solutions, year after year.</p>
